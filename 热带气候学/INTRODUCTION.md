# Where is Tropics?
- +-23.5˚
- the region of **surplus** radiation   (incoming>outgoing)    (±35~40˚)
- (atmos,ocean)
-  Heat Trans. by Ocean and Atm.(Atmos > Ocean)
- zonal wind trans. separated in 5˚N(center of ITCZ)
- south semi. has larger basin, but has less ocean heat trans. (MOC=>atlantic meridional overturning circulation)
- the region of net upward motion =>low pressure in surface
- Indian Ocean Low east wind=>MJO is not based on east-transport
- **eastern wave** (exclusively in tropical area)
- annual cyclone()
- Riehl(1979)described the tropics as 'that part of the world there'
- in practice, the region of easterlies ~15˚N in winter 
- **heat engine as atmosphere 
- **rain-fed agriculture =>rain
- **maintain momentum balance**
- little geostrophic F=>less circulation=> more heat transfer=>less temperature grad.
- weak-temperature gradient

# Temperature Profile 
active tropical high more moisture =>large convection
more moisture, more potential heat, positive feedback
